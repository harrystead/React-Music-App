### React Music Player (Lofi Beats)

This project is a React music service that allows you to listen to a library of selected songs, mostly copy-right free lo-fi beats. Here I made use of React Hooks, such as useState, useEffect & useRef, perhaps my favourite aspect of the React framework. I intend soon to attach a Mongo database to the library and turn it into a full-stack application.
